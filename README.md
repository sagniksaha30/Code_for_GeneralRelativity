# Code for General Relativity
This repo contains code for computing various quantities in General Relativity. All the functions can be found in the notebook GRCalculations.nb
Here's a list of the quantities that the code can currently compute:

1. Raise/Lower Vector Indices as well as compute their magnitudes.
2. Christoffel Symbols
3. Covariant Derivatives (vectors/dual vectors)
4. Covariant Derivatives (Rank 2 tensors with both indices either up/down)
5. Riemann Tensor
6. Ricci Tensor
7. Ricci Scalar
8. Einstein Tensor
9. Geodesic Equation 
10. Extrinsic Curvature
11. Expansion (Mean Extrinsic Curvature)
12. Checking Killing Vectors (Killing's Equation)
13. Checking Rank-2 Killing Tensors (Killing's Equation)

**Note :** This is a work in progress - I will be adding more functionality to this code as and when needed.
