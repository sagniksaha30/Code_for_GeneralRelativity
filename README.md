# Code for General Relativity
This repo contains code for computing various quantities in General Relativity. All the functions can be found in the notebook GRCalculations.nb
Here's a list of the quantities that the code can currently compute:

1. Raise/Lower Vector Indices as well as compute their magnitudes.
2. Christoffel Symbols
3. Covariant Derivatives (vectors/dual vectors only - will extend to tensors soon)
4. Riemann Tensor
5. Ricci Tensor
6. Ricci Scalar
7. Einstein Tensor
8. Geodesic Equation 
9. Extrinsic Curvature
10. Expansion (Mean Extrinsic Curvature)

**Note :** This is a work in progress - I will be adding more functionality to this code as and when needed.
